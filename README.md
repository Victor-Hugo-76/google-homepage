Project Google Homepage

For this mini-project, i'll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.
Te goal is to start thinking about how elements get place on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

Using the browser's developer tools (right-clicking something on the page and clicking "inspect element" will get i there) will be my best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out.

The next skills will be helpful for me when i start building. I'll make me sure how to do it:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the page.
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page.
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage.
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage.
5. Center an element horizontally.
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page.
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page.
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere).
